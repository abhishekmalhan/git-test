# git-test
## Testing git command line
### Introduction
Welcome to the package git-test.

This package does nothing!
(Thanks for visiting though :)

This is commit 2 with a pull request (hopefully)

Commit 3 to be directly committed to master.

Some changes here too!

Git shell test

test

These are some changes to check whether merging from a branch that is ahead but does not have this commit creates any problems.
